1. In Terminal, navigate to within module_1 directory.
2. (Optional) Python Virtual Environment (venv) Setup - may/may not be needed. Execute following in terminal to do this setup if necessary or any issues.
    (a) python -m venv venv
    (b) source venv/bin/activate
    (c) python -m pip install Flask 
        (1) My project uses Flask, but not sure if Flask installation is necessary for anyone using app locally or if it carries over via git.
3. Run 'python run.py'
4. Within your web browser (tested with Safari/Chrome), navigate to localhost:8080/ to access the website.

Refer to requirements.txt for further info on my personal setup.
